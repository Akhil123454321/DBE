<h1> DATABASE EXPLORER (DBE) </h1>

_Database Explorer_ is a CMDB application which allows users to view database details, edit existing database details, and new database details, and remove existing database details.

This application is being made for my **Grade 12 IBDP Computer Science HL Internal Assessment**, for which my client is my father.
